Integrating javascript game with Machine Learning

Firstly we had created a snake game with html and javascript and we can control the game by using arrow keys.

Then in the second step we had trained our model using teachable machine and get the code from teachable machine.

Then at last we integrated snake game with the teachable machine code and we had changed the classnames(i.e 

At before arrow keys are used to control the game at last we changed it to our classNames that we are used in teachable machine)
